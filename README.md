# Loan Status Prediction

This project involves predicting the loan status of applicants using machine learning techniques. The notebook walks through the process of importing dependencies, collecting and processing data, visualizing the data, splitting the data into training and testing sets, training a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, evaluating the model, and making predictions.

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to predict whether an applicant's loan will be approved or not based on various factors such as income, loan amount, and credit history.

## Data Collection
The data used in this project is collected from a structured dataset that includes features like applicant income, co-applicant income, loan amount, loan term, and credit history. 

## Data Visualization
Data visualization techniques are used to gain insights into the data and understand the relationships between different features and the target variable.

## Model Training
A Support Vector Machine (SVM) model is used for training on the processed data. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

## Model Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results indicate how well the model can predict loan status.

## Making Predictions
A predictive system is built to make real-time predictions on loan status based on new input data.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
